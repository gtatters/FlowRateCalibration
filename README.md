# FlowRateCalibration

This Shiny app started as a project to learn Shiny.  The app's purpose is to take inputs used in my lab's Volumeter Flowmeter, a device that is used to calibrate lab flow meters (rotameters or electronic flow meters).  

It requires the user have information about current barometric pressure and corrects the measured flow to standard pressure corrected to 0°C and latitude for the purposes of calibrating a gas flow meter. 

By measuring the time required for a known, calibrated volume to be collected, the flow rate, corrected to 0°C can  be determined
